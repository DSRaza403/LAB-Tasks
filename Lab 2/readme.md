## Instructions:

### Step 1: Access Google Colab

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account. If you don't have one, create a Google account.

### Step 2: Create a New Colab Notebook

3. Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.

### Step 3: Import Required Libraries

4. In the first code cell of the notebook, import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and feature engineering. For example, you can import libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

### Step 4: Load Dataset

5. Upload or load your dataset into Google Colab. You can use the Colab interface to upload your dataset or provide a link to an online dataset.

### Step 5: Perform Feature Engineering

6. In the subsequent code cells, perform feature engineering tasks. This can include tasks like:
   - Handling missing data
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling or normalizing features
   - Creating new features
   - Feature selection
   - Any other relevant feature engineering techniques.

### Step 6: Document Your Work

7. Add comments and explanations within the notebook to describe the feature engineering steps you've taken. This documentation should help others understand your process.

### Step 7: Run the Lab Exercise

8. Execute each code cell in the notebook to perform the feature engineering tasks on your dataset.

### Step 8: Verify the Results

9. After running the code cells, make sure to check the results, verify that the feature engineering has been correctly applied, and assess the impact on the dataset.

### Step 9: Share the Lab Link

10. Save your Colab notebook by clicking on "File" and selecting "Save a copy in Drive." This will ensure that your work is saved.

### Step 10: Submission
